<p>>Onam Celebrations in Kerala

The celebrations have a traditional touch to all the festivity and rituals. Here are some of the essential features of the festival:


Onam Pookalam

Flower beds and floral decorations are known as Pookalam. It is the first thing that comes to mind when talking about the legend of Mahabali and Onam. The traditional Pookalam consists of ten rings which indicate the ten-day rituals performed during Onam starting from Atham and ending on Thiruonam in the month of Chingam.


It stands as a sign of secularism. It symbolises the spirit of unity and teamwork as all the members of the family together complete it. Different kinds of beautiful flowers are used to complete the intricate design of Pookalam. The design starts on the day of Atham and ends on Thiruvonam, signifying the good old days during King Mahabali’s reign.


Onasadhya

The harvest festival of Kerala is celebrated with a colourful feast served on a banana leaf featuring over 25 dishes called “Onam Sadhya.” Onasadhya is a famous traditional meal of Kerala and is served on a banana leaf on the last day of the festival, Thiruonam. It means Onam food feast, which is a symbol of prosperity that existed during the rule of Mahabali. The people of Kerala try to ensure that their King Mahabali sees them with the grandest meal on this auspicious day. All the people across all regions in Kerala prepare grand Onasadhya on this day.


The traditional food is served on a big, properly washed, green banana leaf with a Pappad on the left. Sarkaravaratti, banana wafers, salt, and fries are served on the right side of the pappad, next to which lies the ginger lime and mango pickles. Vegetarian items like pavakka, ullikitchadi, and kitchadi are placed next. Thoran is served after these items, and after the meal payasam is served as a dessert.


Snake Boat Races

Another important and prominent festivity is the ‘Snake Boat Race’ held in ‘Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple.’ The famous harvest festival of Kerala is celebrated in the month of Chingam, which is in August and September. It is the best time to visit Kerala and experience the traditions of the state. Kerala is full of magnificence during Onam. One can also enjoy the exotic taste of Onasadhya, participate in decorating Pookalam, and witness the true beauty of Kerala during this festival.


Pulikali

Similar to any other traditional and cultural event, this also includes a lot of dancing and singing associated with Onam celebrations. Pulikali, also known as Kaduvakali, is a beautiful folk art that is skillfully performed by well-trained dancers to amuse and entertain the people at the festival. The artists dance excitedly and perform the hunting moves with the beat of the musical instruments.


In Malayali, Pulikali means ‘play of the tigers.’ On the fourth day of Onam, known as Nalaam Onam, performers paint themselves as hunters and tigers with yellow, black, and red paints and dance to the sound of thrilling music like Thakil and Udukku. The theme of the performance is based on ‘tiger hunting.’


The dance is famous in the ‘Thrissur District’ of Kerala. The best place to witness the dance is ‘Swaraj Round,’ where Pulikali performing groups from the entire district gather to perform folk art. This humongous festival attracts a lot of attention from around the world during this season.
